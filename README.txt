-Description-
Reason uses AWS’s search provider, Cloudsearch, to index and retrieve records from our site. In this exercise, please build a JavaScript client (app, component, or single page) to query our site search that 
meets the following requirements:

● The code and a functioning demonstration can be viewed. This could be in an online sandbox, any publicly available hosted page, or even a self-contained file with clear instructions.
● The demonstration displays search results based on a user’s text input showing at least headline, author bylines original published date, and an image, if available.
● The demonstration includes some visual styling beyond the browser defaults. Use this as an opportunity to show your coding style and approach. Feel free to add features or enhance the design, but the 
priority should be on meeting the requirements and writing code that can be understood by others. Feel free, but not obligated to use any framework, build tools, or code standards that you are comfortable with.
